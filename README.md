# 9_HelpingHands: All India Hackathon Project

## Overview

Welcome to the **9_HelpingHands** repository! This project is our submission for the All India Hackathon, aimed at addressing the challenges faced by underprivileged children and residents of old age homes. We have developed a web application to promote charity, facilitate donations, and encourage volunteering to make a positive impact on the lives of these marginalized groups.

## Problem Statement

The limited access and resources available to underprivileged children and the elderly in shelters have led to a disparity in their quality of life. Our project focuses on creating a user-friendly platform to bridge the gap between donors and recipients, ensuring that essential items and support reach those in need.

## Features

- **Donation:** Easily donate funds, books, clothes, and other essentials through a user-friendly interface.

- **Volunteer Opportunities:** Explore and contribute your time and skills by volunteering at shelters.
